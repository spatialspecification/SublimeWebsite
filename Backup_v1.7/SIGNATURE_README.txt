SUBLiME signature logo – for email signatures and documents
==========================================================

Files:
------
• SUBLiME_signature_logo.svg  – Logo + "SUBLiME" + "Concreting" in one SVG (transparent background, dark text).
• signature-logo.html          – Same layout on a white card; open in a browser to screenshot or export.

How to get a PNG for email/documents:
-------------------------------------
1. SVG → PNG
   - Open SUBLiME_signature_logo.svg in Chrome/Firefox (keep it in the same folder as SUBLiME_logo_NoBG.png).
   - Use an online converter (e.g. cloudconvert.com, svgtopng.com) or a desktop app to export as PNG.
   - Or: right‑click the opened SVG page → Save as / export as image (if your browser supports it).

2. HTML → PNG (recommended)
   - Open signature-logo.html in a browser (same folder as SUBLiME_logo_NoBG.png).
   - Crop a screenshot to the white “signature” block, or use a browser extension like “GoFullPage” or “Awesome Screenshot” to capture just that element and save as PNG.

3. Email signature
   - Insert the PNG into your email client’s signature settings (e.g. Gmail: Settings → See all settings → Signature → insert image).

Design:
-------
- Logo (SUBLiME_logo_NoBG.png) on the left.
- “SUBLiME” in bold dark grey/black.
- “Concreting” in smaller grey below.
- Layout and fonts match the website header; colours are tuned for white backgrounds (documents and typical email).
